# okcandidate-okcontact

When OKCandidate users take the survey to match them with the politician who best aligns with their views, they are given the option of receiving a notification a few days before the election.  Users have the opportunity to opt in for a reminder e-mail, SMS message, or both.  OKContact will be the program to notify these users, and provide them with a link to their survey results.  This will be done in part through the Twillio API.
