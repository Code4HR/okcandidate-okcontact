# okcandidate-okcontact

[OK Candidate](https://www.github.com/Code4HR/okcandidate) is a web app for matching voters with candidates for local offices.  [OK Candidate](https://www.github.com/Code4HR/okcandidate) is being developed by [Code For Hampton Roads](https://www.github.com/Code4HR), a local [Code For America Bridge](http://brigade.codeforamerica.com/brigade/) 


When [OK Candidate](https://www.github.com/Code4HR/okcandidate) users take the survey to match them with the politician who best aligns with their views, they are given the option of receiving a notification a few days before the election.  Users have the opportunity to opt in for a reminder e-mail, SMS message, or both.  OKContact will be the program to notify these users, and provide them with a link to their survey results.  This will be done in part through the [Twillio API](https://www.twilio.com).
